# Create wallet

To interact with the [Sway Lend](https://app.swaylend.com) platform, you'll first need to connect a wallet. There are three options for doing this:

1. Generate a new account by clicking the "Connect to Wallet" button and then clicking the "Create Account" button in the modal window that appears. After generating the account, you can copy the seed phrase for safekeeping by clicking the "Copy Seed" button.
2. Connect a Fuel Wallet, which is currently in alpha testing. For more information on how to do this, please follow this link: [https://wallet.fuel.network/](https://wallet.fuel.network/).
3. Insert mnemonic phrase 12 words long.

Please make sure that your Fuel Wallet is connected to the latest testnet beta 3 in order to sign transactions successfully. If your wallet is not connected to the latest testnet beta 3, you won't be able to sign transactions. Link is [https://beta-3.fuel.network/graphql](https://beta-3.fuel.network/graphql)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If a user creates a new account in Fuel Wallet after connecting to SwayLend app, they must disconnect and reconnect their wallet to grant access to the newly created account.
{% endhint %}

Once you have connected your wallet, you'll be ready to start using the Sway Lend platform.
