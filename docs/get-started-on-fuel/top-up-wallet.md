# Top up wallet

The next step is to acquire some funds in your wallet. To mint tokens on the Fuel network, you'll need to have some ETH in your wallet to pay transaction fees. There are two ways to obtain ETH:

1. The first is through the main [faucet link](https://faucet-beta-3.fuel.network).
2. The second is by visiting the [Faucet page](https://app.swaylend.com/#/faucet) on our app, which features a table with all tokens supported by our platform, including UNI, USDC, BTC, LINK, and Sway (the utility token for our application). Note that to mint any token other than ETH, you must have some ETH in your wallet first.
